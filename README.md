This is my first website project for college assessment. 

I used C# for my back-end. HTML, CSS and JavaScript for front-end. 

Also, I added some bootstrap templates. 

In the dataBaseInitialazer file you can find assigned user roles and login details. Feel free to test them all.

Admin will have an admin dashboard for Users CRUD.

Moderators have a moderator dashboard for Comments and Post CRUD. 

Customers can leave comments on the blog page.

Suspended customers can't leave comments. 

The application might look pretty simple, but because it is my first web-app it was really challenging for me.
